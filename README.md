## CommandTools

A variety of library working together to ease the setup and control of Arduino devices. Tools are generic and can be approached and used at different levels.

The [commanduino](https://github.com/croningp/commanduino) python library complement these tools by allowing automatic discovery and instantiation of devices on multiple Arduino boards using a simple config file.
